## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run package`

Builds the `share-lambda.zip` file for uploading to the share lambda.

## Converting assets

The main assets (not the icons) need to be PNGs to work with merge-images-v2. To convert source SVGs to PNGs I used https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png to do this, for which I created an account (using Facebook Auth) for in order to do this in bulk.  From their per file options, choose the `chrome` Engine and specify the output width and height as `936 x 880`.
